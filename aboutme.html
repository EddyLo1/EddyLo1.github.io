  <h1>Bothering People</h1>
  Hello world I am Eddy Loja I am 16 years old and I like to bother people like my friend Dennis. He gets annoyed easily but just deals with it because he's Dennis. I dont know why I do this I just do mostly because im bored.Dennis is usually nearby and is easy to get a reaction from.
  <h1>Other Things In School</h1>
  I have to go to school everyday and have to go up 4 flights of stairs. The only thing that is good about school is the people. Its less boring since I have friends to talk to while we have different classes. I dont really care much about my classes. I also have alot of projects I do in school for many classes together with classmates.
  <h1>Things I dislike</h1>
  I dislike when I get low grades in assaignments. I also dislike when I have to reach things in high places because im short. I also hate when people just stare at me because I don't do anything and its weird. I also hate having to do things in PE because I am not alethic. I also hate traveling because it takes to long and I like my bed. I also hate having to much hair because its hard to maintain.
