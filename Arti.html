<h1> Filtered Photo Kaleidoscope </h1>

	<body>I first got a random image and inserted it into photoshop. I then altered the way it looked like the filter and started duplicating it. I started changing the direction some go and it looked like a new image. I managed to make it blend into each other to turn into a kaleidoscope.</body>

	<body>This was just what I thought would be in an old retro game in the background. I also just wanted to make it have a creepy moon like a horror level. It would just follow the player around and move with the surroundings. It was a basic design but I feel like I could improve on it in the future.</body>

	<body>I used the program to just make a random collage of photos. I wanted something that would represent me in a couple of different pictures like for example the one with books saying how I like to read. I used pictures that were old and from architecture so I could describe what I want to do. Canva allowed me to put pictures over each other without them overlapping and not making it a mess. I think the pictures I took matched my aesthetic because it shows what I like and do without words.<body/>

	<br>
	<body>My social justice topic is gun violence and I chose this topic because it's something that needs to be taken care of since it's been happening more and more recently. This topic is important because it's now children in schools who are suffering from this since now it's become an issue for kids in elementary schools. It has become easier to get a gun than it is to get a dog since owning a dog requires more background checks than a gun check. I put the images like this because I wanted to show how its affecting children mostly in their schools. I honestly wanted to show how people protest but still nothing has been done about the problem.

	<body>I opened up photoshop and picked out an object I ended up using a flower figure and duplicated it a couple of times. After a bit I changed the color and decided on going with blue and some type of pink. I then duplicated the layers and changed the position they were in until finally it made a circle and then I duplicated that layer and used the transform tool to scale it and make it smaller than the original. I then rotated it and after a while it turned into a spiral pattern.
